# Medley

Welcome to **Medley**, a simple music player designed to simplify your listening experience, while also having features like Last.fm and Discord Rich Presence integration.

This is a very early version of Medley, so expect some bugs. However, I can promise a relatively painless listening experience with what I have so far.

## Installation

To install Medley, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/georgeh04/Medley/releases) page.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Launch Medley from your desktop or start menu.

### Adding Music to Medley

Upon launching Medley for the first time, a window will appear for you to choose your music directory, which it will automatically scan and add music to.

If you want to add more music to Medley, or rescan your files, here is how you do so.

1. Open Medley.
2. Click on the "Settings"/cog button.
3. Click on the "Resync Library" button.
4. Select your music directory.
5. Medley will automatically scan the directory and add tracks to your library.

## Roadmap

We have many exciting features planned for future releases of Medley, including:
- Online features like reviewing, listing and music discussion.

Stay tuned for more :)
